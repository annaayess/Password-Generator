# Password-Generator
This is a Random Password Generator.
The Purpose of this webpage is for users to be able to generate passwords based on preferences that are asked by prompts.
These preferences include : 
-length of password (between 8 and 128 characters)
-symbols ( #$^ etc.)
-numbers
-uppercase letters
-lowercase letters
After these prompts are either accepted or rejected the user is given a random password which they can then use for any
purpose.
